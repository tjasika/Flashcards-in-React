# Flashcards in React 🖥️
### My first React.js project
I’ve finally started learning React, and to kick things off, I built this simple flashcards app.  
The cards cover topics I studied this year in university — mainly Computer Science, including Data Structures and Algorithms. The goal was to grasp the basic React concepts (mainly *useState*).  
For styling, I decided to use *TailwindCSS* (and *Bootstrap icons*). After a bit of struggling getting everything set up, I ended up really enjoying the utility-first approach and now have a much better understanding of how it works.
